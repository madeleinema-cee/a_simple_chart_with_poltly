Company Headcount is a data visualization website made with <i>Python framework Django</i>, <i>Sqlite database</i>,
 <i>JavaScript</i>, <i>HTML</i>, <i>CSS</i>, and <i>Plotly JavaScript Graphing library</i>. 
The website presents a interactive line chart showing the headcount for companies for every month between 2008 to 2019.
By clicking on the Dropdown menu, up to three companies can be selected. 

The demo website is deployed on my Linux Ubuntu 20.10 server.
