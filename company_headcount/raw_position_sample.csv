Scientific calculation/Python integration: I had to design and implement a solution for a scientific project. The core calculation was written in Python and referenced special mathematical libraries but the presentation layer and the public service were in C# (.NET Core 3.0). The application was hosted in Azure and fully scalable (it was a requirement because the calculation was slow). I built the full CI/CD system with Azure Devops. Work as ‚Äûdevops‚Äù: I had to construct our CI/CD system with TeamCity (cloud solution was prohibited by our customer) from scratch for .NET Core builds. We had almost 100 project setup and I used unified templates to reduce configuration overhead. This helped us unify our code base as well (similar directory structure and name convention\, etc...). Code analysis (SonarQube)\, test runner (XUnit) were included beside the standard source code build. I created an internal TC based Nuget server as well - with version (e.g. pre release nuget) handling. The artifacts (docker images) were uploaded to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) as Kubernetes workloads. The environments settings were controlled by Kubernetes configuration mapping (instead of individual configuration files per deployment). The next plan was to introduce Octopus deploy (with advanced deployment options) and integrate with TC. SSO: Single Sing-On system implementation (based on Identity Server 4) with customized user service. We integrated this with external authentication as well (Active Directory and OpenLDAP). This project used the TeamCity CI/CD system (created by me). Mobile app backend: Backend part of a mobile application. We used microservices with queue based (RabbitMQ) communication included various databases (PostgreSQL/MongoDB/MsSql...). It based on .NET Core and deployed to GCP. This project used the TeamCity CI/CD system (created by me).","2017-03-01",""

By attending HR/L&D conferences\, barcamps\, meet ups and workshops\, by growing my professional network and aquiring knowlegde through MOOCs and online courses on all major learning platforms. Sharpening my profile in two important areas of expertise: Learning & Development Digital Learning\, Gamification\, Storytelling\, Instructional Design\, UX Design (User Experience) - topics I added to my portfolio\, because tomorrow won‚Äôt be about course catalogues\, but about a mixture of platforms and tools to share and expand knowledge\, and about constant learning journeys available anywhere and at any time. Studying in worldwide distributed teams\, the use of technical possibilities and peer learning opened up a window to a new world of development for me. Adding the Design Thinking approach\, I now combine my knowledge of traditional learning and teaching methods with new ways of learning\, building the bridge between the two worlds and transfering content into our exciting future. Digitization and Big Data/Data Science Digital and Social Media Marketing\, Content Strategy\, People Analytics\, Big Data courses and an Executive Data Science Specialization - I added all of them to my portfolio because the future will be digital. Considering the importance of keeping up with communication and collaboration methods\, I am a proficient user of Slack\, Yammer\, Trello and Social Media platforms. Considering the fact that the world today is able to measure even our sentiments in conversations\, I see the knowledge of using Big Data/Analytics as a way to help HR gain better insight and make better decisions.

"5852320262212101147",".....","Debt","","","From 2000 to present\, the U.S. debt (owed by federal\, state and local governments) increased from $1T to $20T due to three main expenses: ‚Ä¢ trillions for annual federal budget deficits from 2002 to today (Every year since 2002\, the federal government spent more than its income. The 2019 deficit is expected to be $1T. The 2018 deficit was $0.8T\, which was due to $4.1T in spending and $3.3T in income.) ‚Ä¢ trillions for impacts of the Great Recession from 2007 to 2014 (The recession was mainly due to unwise banking regulations and worsened by oil prices of $80+ per barrel. Impacts included reduced tax revenue ‚Äî from reduced\, and lost\, incomes of workers ‚Äî and from increased government welfare benefits for the underemployed and unemployed.) ‚Ä¢ $2T for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan Of the $20T debt\, Americans hold most of it. The Chinese and Japanese each hold $1T. Future costs: ‚Ä¢ $120T+ in unfunded\, future liabilities of the federal government\, such as for future Social Security benefits owed to 70+ million baby boomers. ‚Ä¢ trillions more on healthcare as well as Medicare and Social Security benefits for baby boomers. ‚Ä¢ a few trillion on restoration of America‚Äôs infrastructure and impacts of climate change. Annual deficit: ‚Ä¢ Since 1976\, America‚Äôs private debt grew each year that we spent more on imports than we earned from exports. ‚Ä¢ Today's annual trade deficit is $0.5T. (It peaked at $0.8T in 2008\, when high oil prices contributed to devaluation of the dollar.) - Potential Solutions - All of the above solutions. Increase tax revenue by increasing (taxable) personal incomes through solutions described in the Wealth Gap section. Avoid repeating mistakes\, such as by improving banking regulations and investing more in renewable energy. Consume less imports and/or increase exports. Reduce government spending\, and increase tax rates. (These solutions are usually unpopular with the public.)","2019-03-01","2019-03-01"

I have a proven track record both of consulting and training the management and superiors in those areas. I am no stranger either to business strategy work and establishing a new business area or the everyday operative work in HR. My experience runs from recruiting processes to co-operation negotiations\, from employer branding to authority and trade union relations\, as well as management team work including company strategy update and founding a new business area. I also have some knowledge of project management\, occupational safety & health issues as well as HR coaching. Having worked for both small and major Finnish companies and co-operations I have seen the diversity of organizations and their need for HR services. In my positions of trust (both professional and civil life interests) I have gathered experience in change management\, planning and execution of the purpose of the association or foundation as well as public relations and communications as the chair or a member of the board.","2020-05-01",""
"-672877974516037780","__","I am asked these three questions most often:","","","1.) What do I do? I orchestrate change. Just as an orchestra conductor works with individual musicians\, sections\, and the whole orchestra to bring them all together to improve performance\, I work with people\, teams\, and organizations to help them break free from the self-limiting beliefs and ineffective behaviors that keep them from reaching their full potential and magnifying their professional and personal effectiveness. 2.) How do I do it? When you work with me you get three things: a guide\, a catalyst\, and a partner. First\, you get a deeply experienced guide who not only has successfully coached dozens of teams\, but who has 30+ years of corporate experience in many different industries. I've been where you are ‚Äì from the cubicle to the boardroom. Having a guide that understands the entire terrain of the journey is a tremendous advantage. Second\, you get a catalyst for the change you are seeking. In nature nothing changes without a catalyst. Transformational change is about working with individuals and teams\, educating\, guiding\, and influencing so that we can unlock their potential\, empowering them to be the change that they want and the organization needs. Third\, you get an open and honest partner who will walk this path beside you - one who listens to your unique concerns and who works with you to co-create a solution that is tailored for your particular situation. Having and experienced guide\, a persistent catalyst\, and a pragmatic partner provides you with a powerful advantage on this transformational journey. 3.) Why do I do it? We must escape the limited Industrial Age thinking and advance to Information Age thinking. We need everyone contributing at their best. Empowering people to realize their highest potential is critical for us all to thrive.","1998-01-01",""

"-7648329976377911057",".","Senior Maritime Analyst","","Portsmouth\, United Kingdom","I joined Dryad Maritime in 2012 employed in the then Portsmouth HQ. The watch keeping team ensured 24 hour support to commercial vessels\, assuming responsibility for tracking and advising merchant ships as they approached and transited through areas of risk. I was promoted to a role as Regional Analyst\, my prime area of responsibility focusing on West African piracy and maritime crime. I wrote Transit Risk Assessments for client‚Äôs commercial vessels transiting primarily into Nigeria\, an area where mariners continue to be at high risk of kidnap in open ocean by heavily armed pirates. Those vessels were supported with initial alerts and analysis of incidents as they occurred . At this time I also initiated a weekly Port Risk Assessment for 15 terminals and ports in Libya. This report advised Company Security Officers and Masters of vessels\, which ports are relatively secure to trade at\, and which ones should be avoided. The advice would be justified with information supporting my analysis. Reports and assessments were also written for Indian Ocean‚Äôs areas\, where Somali based pirates reappeared on the scene during 2017. We also developed a web based ‚ÄòWorld Risk Map‚Äô. The World Risk Map was designed in such a way that clients can easily navigate to a country of their choice\, and read an overview of current political and security developments within that country. This negated the need for them to commission a more detailed\, but less timely\, formal risk assessment for that country. In 2016 I was promoted to Senior Analyst within the company. In late 2017 I was promoted to Interim Head of Operations\, a position that I held for four months until the vacancy was permanently filled. I then resumed the role of Senior Analyst. I was made redundant in June 2018 when Dryad's 24/7 operations set up in the Portsmouth area finally closed down altogether.","2012-07-01","2018-06-01"

He recognizes that people working together towards the same goals need to collaborate to maximize their effectiveness. I whole-heartedly recommend Scott for his attention to detail\, ability to relate to people at different levels in the organization\, and tenacity to get the job done! Cedric Mengelil Warning Officer at Civil Defense October 14\, 2010\, Scott worked with Cedric in the same group Scott is a very detail oriented person and good analyst when it comes to research. His interesting background over the years qualifies him for the career path he is now. He is a thoughtful person around the work environment. Christy Jobe Carter Program\, Organizational\, Change Management / Communications; Research / Analytics February 24\, 2010\, Christy managed Scott directly Scott was one of my brightest stars as an employee. He was on top of the customer's requests\, and more often than not\, way ahead of the request. His writing was concise and complete\, his understanding of all aspects of the position and the customer needs were 100%. His work ethic is one of the strongest I have run into in my career.

The trio plays both modern original and traditional music from the Middle East and gives an absorbing portrayal of contemporary music styles played within traditional oriental music. The goal of the trio is to generate interest in a more classic and quality-conscious dimension of Middle Eastern music. The trio‚Äôs repertoire consists of original compositions written by Bilal Irshed as well as re-arranged traditional pieces. When it comes to choosing this material the trio has been very critical and only chosen the best from some of the greatest composers in the history of Arabic and Turkish music. In 2011 Bilal released his first album with the Trio. The music on the album\, ‚ÄòCompositions‚Äô\, was written and arranged by Bilal over a number of years and the album was therefore the result of many influences from his travels and experiences. Bilal¬¥s Trio is a tribute to the sound of the oud\, whose warm and meditative sound serves to capture the history and the beauty of the Orient. However\, by combining this sound with a Cuban percussion and the double bass from the Scandinavian jazz tradition\, the oud has been placed in a more interesting and contemporary context.","2011-01-01",""

"4338226907001179547","*","Project Leader\, composer and Oud Player of The Fifth String Ensemble and music project","","Denmark","The project takes it name from a 9th century Arab musician named Ziryab. He is considered to be the founder of the Andalusian musical tradition in the Arab world and was one of the pioneers of Arab influence on Spanish music. He is also credited with having added a fifth string to the then four-stringed oud. According to legend\, Ziryab coloured the first four strings so that they would symbolise Aristotle‚Äôs four temperaments.Then he added a fifth that would represent the soul. It is from this fifthstring that the project draws its inspiration. The Fifth String was created by Bilal and the music consists of original compositions combined with new arrangements of traditional Middle Eastern tunes. The sound and atmosphere of chamber music was then added to these compositions\, serving to create a whole new musicalexperience and sound. In 2011 the ensemble recorded and released their first album entitled ‚ÄòThe Fifth String‚Äô. The recording took place in Copenhagen\, Nazareth andand Bethlehem\, which ensured that both the classical and the Middle Eastern parts were recorded by true specialist in their field. The result was later mixed and mastered in Denmark. In January 2012\, The Fifth String gave a very successful concert at Brorson‚Äôs Church in Copenhagen celebrating the release of the album. The current set-up of the ensemble is Joel Gonzalez on Double Bass\,Toke M√∏ldrup on Cello\, Yohan Ramon on percussion\, Alexander √òllgaardon Viola\, Luciano Direnzo on Violin and Bilal irshed on Oud.","2011-01-01",""

"5818203369096286725","","Ski Enthusiast and Job Seeker","","Salt Lake City\, UT","I am grateful to many people during my time of transition as they shaped my outlook on career and life. - Companions on ski lifts who are equally passionate about their jobs as they are on skiing. They included weather forecaster for the Airforce\, NYC fireman and stay-at-home dad. I know you will be successful because you love your jobs and I heard it in your voices. - Fitness instructors and coaches who pushed me outside boundaries of comfort. You love what you do and make me feel I can achieve anything because I survived your class. - Career counsellor and job recruiter who were as caring as they were professional. I am fortunate to have you look after my interests and even more fortunate to call you friends. - People I met in interviews who were genuine\, candid and fun. You gave me choices but also difficult career decisions\, for which I am grateful. - My previous team members who have all dispersed. Great memories and we have all moved on for the better. I am sure I will have the honor of working with some of you again. - ExCo peers who didn't call to say goodbye\, probably because they were feeling bad for me. I will reach out again if you don't do it first. - Colleagues who told my spouse (who works for same company)\, words of support and praise. I received your messages which were enlightening and comforting. - Dearest colleague and friend who would 'take a bullet for me'. Your testimonial\, wisdom and advice has made me a better person. - Three teenage children who I spent valuable time with\, until I was brutally told to go back to work because I wasn't a good stay-at-home mom. I guess I have your permission to return to work! - Partner in life who gives me courage\, has been both a leading and trailing spouse in the many cities we have lived in\, and shared our responsibilities at home so we can both be successful at work. I have been lucky in knowing the best. Sometimes it takes a little hardship to fully appreciate love and companionship in its many forms.","2016-11-01","2017-03-01"
